# `Dilan's Soundscape  - 'Conversation With Demetrius'`

For my Soundscape I explored the audible effect of cell phones on conversations. The soundscape will feature a scattered conversation between two people along with many recognizable sounds and tones.

This project was created with various sounds from https://freesound.org/ along with self-recorded conversation audio.

Audacity project and mp3 is located in `Soundscape/`
