# Dilan's Soundscape Repo

For my Soundscape I plan on exploring the audible effect of cell phones and social media have on our everyday relationships. I would use these sounds to exemplify how often we are hearing these sounds on a daily basis and how they can disrupt connections and conversations with the people around you. The soundscape will feature a scattered conversation between two people along with many recognizable sounds and tones.

Self-Sourced Sounds:

* Audio of myself and a friend talking in a public space
* Background voices of other students
* Background footsteps
* Zipping backpacks
* Picking up/putting down cell phone
* Phone vibrations
* Phone text/call tones

Sources Sounds:

* Light background music
* Various social media sounds (Snapchat, instagram, etc.)
